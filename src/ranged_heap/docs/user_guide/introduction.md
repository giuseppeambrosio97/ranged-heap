# Introduction

The RangedHeap data structure is designed to maintain a collection of choices associated with integer values within a specified range. This makes it particularly useful for greedy algorithms where the choices are integer-ranged (0-k). In this document, we will explore how the RangedHeap can be utilized in various greedy algorithm scenarios.
