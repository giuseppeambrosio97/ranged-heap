# Roadmap

This document outlines the planned future improvements and features for the Ranged Heap library. The following tasks are on our roadmap:

## [ ] Parametrize the choice in RangedHeap

Enhance the RangedHeap data structure to allow parameterization of choices. This feature will enable users to customize the behavior of the heap according to their specific needs.

## [ ] CICD with GitHub Actions

Set up Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CICD) pipelines using GitHub Actions. This will automate testing, building, and deployment processes, ensuring a smoother and more reliable development workflow.

## [ ] Improve performance with C++/Rust binding

Integrate C++ or Rust bindings to improve the performance of the Ranged Heap library. By leveraging the speed and efficiency of these lower-level languages, we aim to provide faster operations and reduce overhead.

## [ ] Add more usage examples

Expand the documentation with additional usage examples. These examples will cover a broader range of scenarios and use cases, helping users to better understand how to effectively utilize the Ranged Heap library.
